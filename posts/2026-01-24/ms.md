President Trump and Microsoft have established a new national precedent regarding AI infrastructure. Under the "Tax Accord," Microsoft agreed to pay full property taxes and forego electricity discounts for its data centers. The administration is treating access to the U.S. power grid as a premium product, forcing "hyperscalers" to pay their own way. Simultaneously, the EPA cracked down on Elon Musk’s xAI for using unpermitted methane generators in Memphis, ruling that the "National Emergency" of AI does not grant immunity from environmental laws.

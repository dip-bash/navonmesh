On January 23, 2026, Apple dismantled its "Not Invented Here" doctrine by partnering with Google to build next-generation foundation models on Gemini architecture. Internal friction led Software VP Craig Federighi to prioritize product efficacy over technological sovereignty after Apple’s internal teams failed to cross the "compute density" moat.

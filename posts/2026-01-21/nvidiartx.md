Gamers seeking to upgrade to the flagship NVIDIA RTX 5090 are facing a brutal reality as retail stock has completely vanished from major outlets like Best Buy and Newegg. In the resulting vacuum, third-party sellers have driven prices to nearly $4,000—double the official MSRP and roughly the cost of an entire pre-built system. The shortage is attributed to a combination of RAM scarcity and Nvidia’s reported pivot to prioritize high-margin AI data center chips over consumer gaming products. Rumors suggest that Nvidia may have even halted production of certain high-end variants to redirect silicon toward the booming enterprise market. With prices of essential components like DDR5 and SSDs also climbing, the cost of custom PC building is reaching a historic peak, forcing many enthusiasts to consider pre-built alternatives or defer upgrades indefinitely.

In response to this hardware crunch, Intel has attempted to position itself as the champion of the consumer. At CES 2026, Intel launched its "Panther Lake" family, claiming its integrated Arc B390 GPU can match the performance of discrete Nvidia mobile chips.18 Intel’s strategy appears to be one of "integrated validation"—offering powerful, all-in-one consumer chips that bypass the need for expensive, separate GPUs.19 This stands in stark contrast to AMD, which has been criticized for neglecting its consumer base to focus almost exclusively on data center and AI roadmaps.19

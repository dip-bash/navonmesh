As companies like Anthropic and OpenAI release autonomous "agent" tools, cybersecurity experts are warning of a new class of systemic risks. A critical vulnerability has been identified in Anthropic’s "Cowork" that could allow for unauthorized file exfiltration if the agent is hijacked via indirect prompt injection—where malicious text hidden in a file or website overrides the user’s instructions. Additionally, researchers at Wiz have uncovered a catastrophic flaw in AWS CodeBuild that could have led to full cloud compromise, averting a "historic near miss." The shift toward agentic AI requires a fundamental rethink of broken access control, which remains the number one risk in the updated OWASP Top 10\. Experts argue that while AI agents can drive massive productivity gains, they also make mistakes faster than humans can catch, demanding new layers of "instruction detectors" and "supply chain" security to prevent autonomous systems from becoming a liability.

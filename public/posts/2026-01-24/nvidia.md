NVIDIA is set to shatter the forty-year x86 duopoly with its new "N1" and "N1X" Arm-based processors for Windows. Leaked specifications for the N1X reveal 20 Arm cores and Blackwell-based integrated graphics that rival a desktop RTX 5070. Major manufacturers, including Lenovo and Dell, are already prepping N1-powered laptops for a Spring 2026 launch. This "Apple Silicon moment" for the PC market threatens Intel and AMD’s dominance by offering superior power efficiency and gaming performance in thin-and-light chassis.
